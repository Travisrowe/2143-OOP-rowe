This program, AsciiShop.py, will take an image of a cat from a specified URL, convert that image to greyscale, then to ASCII. It will then print that image as a string, and "invert the color" and print the inverted image as well.
The code has functionalities to allow flipping the original ASCII image horizontally or vertically, as well as cropping the original image.
Ideally, I would have liked to include the functionality to use a local image of the user's choice, but I struggled to implement this.
To work around being unable to find a local image, type N when prompted "Do you have an image of your own? (Y/N)."
